## Aliases
Both Tables and Columns can be aliased - given a temporarily different name during the query execution. It's a not a permanent rename of the table / column.

### Column Aliases
```sql
SELECT
	inv_no AS invoice_no,
	amount,
	due_date AS 'Due date',
	cust_no 'Customer No'
	salary * 1.1 AS new_salary
FROM
	invoices;
```
- Note that AS keyword is optional
- quotes needed for alias with spaces
- salary is example of  adding expression as new generated columns

### Alias Mis-uses
Important to keep in mind the query execution order when referencing aliases:
FROM > WHERE > SELECT > ORDER BY > LIMIT

This query fails
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    salary * 1.1 AS new_salary
FROM
    employees
WHERE new_salary > 5000
```
- WHERE is evaluated before the SELECT alias definition. 
- Have to use original name 'salary' in WHERE
- Using aliased name in ORDER BY / LIMIT is fine as it's after the SELECT


### Table Alias

Table Alias Example
```sql
SELECT 
    e.first_name, 
    e.last_name
FROM
    employees AS e;
```
- Table Alias defined in the FROM
- SELECT is evaluated after FROM so it's valid

## Joins
Joins are the process of linking multiple tables together to the final result set. 
- two or more tables can be joined, as many are needed for result set
- specify which columns you want from each table
- joining a table can even be joined to itself in a "self join"
	- common [example use case](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3362053) is employee table referencing manager id in same table
- common join use case is linking a primary key to the corresponding foreign key in the child table
- NOTE - foreign keys are NOT required to do a join. Can join any columns provided they have matching type (string, integer, etc.). Foreign keys give the benefit of "referential integrity", you can be sure that parent tables will have child data

The different types of joins just refer to what the result sets will look like

### INNER JOIN
Rows where there is matching data in both tables, the intersection of the VENN Diagram

INNER JOIN sample 
```sql
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    employees.department_id,
    departments.department_id,
    department_name
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments ON departments.department_id = employees.department_id
WHERE
    employees.department_id IN (1 , 2, 3);
```
- get all employees in departments 1,2,3 along with some data from department table
- NOTE - the above will have two separate department_id columns. You may not want this, and can just include one.
- If joining all columns with, can use NATURAL JOIN to avoid duplicate columns

### LEFT JOIN / LEFT OUTER JOIN
All rows in left table, rows with matching columns in right table, The full left circle of VENN diagram

- RIGHT OUTER JOIN is the same thing as LEFT, just reversed. Can accomplish the same result by switching the table order (this is what SQLAlchemy ORM also recommends in their api)

Left Join Sample
```sql
SELECT
	c.country_name,
	c.country_id,
	l.street_address,
	l.city
FROM
	countries AS c
LEFT JOIN locations AS l ON l.country_id = c.country_id
WHERE
	c.country_id IN ('US', 'UK', 'CN')
```
- get country and location data for company sites in US, UK, and CHINA
- if there are no locations in China, the location columns would be returned as NULL as per the LEFT join definition (if you don't want this, use the inner join)

Left Self Join Sample - get employee list with their manager
```sql
SELECT 
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee,
    m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name AS manager
FROM
    employees AS e
        LEFT JOIN
    employees AS m ON m.employee_id = e.manager_id
ORDER BY manager;
```
- note the use of aliasing the same table once as employees, once as managers. That's what makes this a "SELF JOIN"
- LEFT join is done to include the president who doesn't have a manager. To exclude the president, use an INNER join
- || is string concatenation syntax in SQL

### FULL OUTER JOIN
Both circles of Venn diagram. This is like the combination of LEFT OUTER and RIGHT OUTER

- take all values of left, with NULLS on right, then all values of right, with NULLs from left

### CROSS JOIN
This is all possible combinations of rows from both tables - the "Cartesian Product"
- No ON clause comparison, just take all combos
- 3 rows in table 1, 4 rows in table 2 -  3 x 4= 12 rows result

[Cross Join vs Full outer sample](https://stevestedman.com/2015/03/full-outer-join-vs-cross-join/)

Cross Join of people and colors table
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.fav_color_id, c.name
FROM people as p
CROSS JOIN colors as c;
```
- get rows for all possible combos of people and colors, regardless what the persons favorite color is

Full outer join of people and colors
```sql
SELECT p.name, p.fav_color_id, c.name
FROM people as p
FULL OUTER JOIN colors as c ON p.fav_color_id = c.id
```
- this will give results for people and their favorite color, but also rows for people with no favorite color, and for colors with no people that like it

## USING vs ON
- USING is used for joins involving columns with the same name in both tables
- ON is used for joins based on specified conditions regardless of column names

USING sample:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
JOIN departments USING (department_id);
```
- assumes that both employees and departments table have a 'department_id' column

ON sample:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.employee_id = departments.dept_employee_id;
```
- here the column names mismatch, so an explicit ON is used to define the join condition
