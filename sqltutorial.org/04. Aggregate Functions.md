Aggregate function operate on a set of values. Commonly used with GROUP BY clauses in order to aggregate groups as well.

Common aggregate functions:
- AVG()
- COUNT()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- SUM()

These functions work on an entire column and return a single value.

Common examples. Get the max salary of all employees. The min salary, the average salary. The sum of everyone's salaries for total payroll. The Count can be used for headcount of the company.

can use aggregates only in SELECT or HAVING clause

get total company headcount 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) AS headcount
FROM employees
```

returns a single scalar value
```sql
headcount
95
```
- note how aggregates work on an entire column and return a single value. Works the same for all other aggregate functions besides count.


get headcount by department using GROUP BY
```sql
SELECT 
    department_name, COUNT(*) AS headcount
FROM
    employees
        INNER JOIN
    departments USING (department_id)
GROUP BY department_name
ORDER BY department_name;
```

return headcount by department
```sql
department_name | headcount
Accounting      |     5
IT              |     7
```
