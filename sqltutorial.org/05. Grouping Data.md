When you need to define subcategories or groups of data, you can use GROUP BY. Can be based on a single column, or multiple columns. 

Common example is to get headcount of employees per location, or per department. Or can group by location AND department.

Without an aggregate function, the GROUP BY behaves like the DISTINCT keyword

```sql
SELECT 
    department_name,
    COUNT(employee_id) headcount
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY department_name
HAVING headcount > 5
ORDER BY headcount DESC;
```
- note the aggregate column
- HAVING is for filtering group, similar to WHERE

Can GROUP BY multiple columns
```sql
SELECT 
    department_name,
    job_title,
    COUNT(employee_id)
FROM
    employees e
        INNER JOIN
    departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
        INNER JOIN
    jobs j ON j.job_id = e.job_id
GROUP BY department_name , 
         job_title;
```
- groups now must satisfy both column requirements

## HAVING clause
Having is like a WHERE filter but is applied AFTER the GROUP BY grouping. WHERE is applied before to all records.

```sql
SELECT 
    department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) BETWEEN 20000 AND 30000
ORDER BY AVG(salary);
```
- having will filter results for groups that have target sum


## GROUPING SETS
This is a shorter way to get a result set from a single query with multiple grouping sets, without using UNIONs.

Also more performant, as generally there will be less passes over the data than running separate queries with unions.

Very useful for reporting summaries to get subtotals and totals based on different criteria.

get total sales by product, by region, and grand total

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    product_id INT,
    region VARCHAR(50),
    sale_date DATE,
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Sample data
INSERT INTO Sales VALUES
(1, 'North', '2023-08-01', 100, 10.00),
(2, 'South', '2023-08-01', 50, 15.00),
(1, 'South', '2023-08-02', 200, 10.00),
(2, 'North', '2023-08-02', 150, 15.00);

-- Query using GROUPING SETS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    region,
    SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((product_id), (region), ());
```
- () is the empty / null set, and this will give the grand total

output
```sql
product_id | region | total_sales
---------------------------------
1          | NULL   | 3000.00
2          | NULL   | 3750.00
NULL       | North  | 2250.00
NULL       | South  | 2750.00
NULL       | NULL   | 6000.00
```

the above example can be accomplished with ROLLUP, an example below with the grouping set of (product_id, region)

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    region,
    SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((product_id, region), (product_id), (region), ());
```
- Rollup can handle product_id and region separately, but not the grouping set with them together.

## ROLLUP
Rollup is a grouping set convenience keyword used specifically for getting subtotals and grand totals.

Rollup vs Grouping Sets:
- ROLLUP is a convenient way to generate subtotals and grand totals using a predefined hierarchy
- GROUPING SETS provides more flexibility to define custom grouping sets for multiple levels of aggregation.

same example using ROLLUP:
```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    region,
    SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP (product_id, region);
```
- notice we don't need to pass the empty set. We get the grand total result automatically (this is 'n + 1' column results)

## CUBE
Cube is an extension of GROUPING SETS. It will automatically generate all possible combinations of sets without needing to explicitly define them. If all the combinations not desired, use GROUPING SETS explicitly.

will get 2^n total set combinations. N being number of columns.

for example, columns X, Y, Z, will generate these 8 grouping sets. (2^3)
```
(X,Y,Z)
(Â  ,Y,Z)
(X,Y, )
(X, ,Y)
(X)
(Y)
(Z)
()
```

```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    region,
    SUM(quantity * price_per_unit) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY CUBE (product_id, region);
```
- this will generate grouping sets of `((product_id, region)(product_id),(region),())`
- in other words, the subtotals for product, region, product_id/region combinations, and the grand total
