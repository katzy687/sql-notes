Inserts can be done for single row, multiple rows, or to copy rows from one table to another


add employee
```sql
INSERT INTO employees ( 
	first_name, 
	last_name, 
	relationship, 
	employee_id ) 
VALUES ( 'Dustin', 'Johnson', 'Child', 178 );
```

add multiple employees
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (
	first_name,
	last_name,
	relationship,
	employee_id
)
VALUES
	(
		'Cameron',
		'Bell',
		'Child',
		192
	),
	(
		'Michelle',
		'Bell',
		'Child',
		192
	);
```

copy rows across tables with SELECT
```sql
INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2) 
SELECT
	column1,
	column2
FROM
	table2
WHERE
	condition1;
```

## Updates
Updates will be against all rows by default. You add a condition to limit the scope of rows

give everybody in department 5 a raise
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET
	salary = 900
WHERE
	department_id = 5
```

## DELETES
similar to UPDATES, will delete all rows if no condition is specified. (so be careful)

```sql
DELETE FROM employees 
WHERE
    id IN (100 , 101, 102);
```
